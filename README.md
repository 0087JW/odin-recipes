# odin-recipes
This current project is the culmination of what <strong>ODIN</strong> has taught me up to this point. <p>What I am about to introduce is a recipe for <em>guacamole</em>, the instructions may not be how I normally make it but they will be close enough.</P>I have learned how to create an <em>html webpage</em>, I can push and pull executions from <strong>github</strong>, and I have further knowlege on <em>terminal use within <strong>VS Code</strong></em>. My goal is to create a foundation for terminal knowlege and coding and to enter a <em>coding boot-camp</em> and one day use this information in a career.#odin-recipes
