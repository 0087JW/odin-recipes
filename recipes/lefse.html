      <h2><em>Norwegian Lefse Treat</em></h2>
      <p>Lefse is a potato pancake coated in white or brown sugar and rolled into a tasty dessert. It is a family tradition and I often make it and use shaped cutters before rolling it to give the lefse a holiday flair.</p>
      <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
      <p>10lbs potatoes (peeled) or equally dried potato flakes, 1/2 butter, 1/3 heavy cream, 1tbsp salt, 1 tbsp white sugar, 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour. </p>
      <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ul>
       <li>Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with water, bring to a boil. Reduce to med-low heat and simmer until soft, then drain.</li>
       <li>Put potatoes through potato ricer (skip this if using potato flakes).</li>
       <li>In a large bowl add potatoes, butter, cream, salt, and sugar. Let cool to room temp.</li>
       <li>Sift flour and add to potato mixture to form a soft dough.</li>
       <li>Use a tablespoon (or smaller) to create a ball of dough and place onto a lightly floured surface, flatten dough until 1/4 inch thick then place on griddle over high heat.</li>
       <li>Cook lefse until brown and blistering (1 minute a side). Place lefse on plate to cool, as an added treat gently sprinkle cinnimon+sugar on each side.</li>
      </ul>
